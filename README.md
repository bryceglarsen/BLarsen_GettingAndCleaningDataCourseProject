# BLarsen_GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
Final assignment for Data Cleaning course of Johns Hopkins Data Science certificate program.

The purpose of this assignment was to take various text files and create separate datasets, merge the datasets, extract features of interest, clean data fields and labels, and perform a mathmetical function on the data to write to a new data set.

This repo contains:
  - run_analysis.R: the R script the reads in the data from UCI HAR Dataset (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and cleans it until the final tidy data set (tidydataset.csv).
  - CodeBook.md: information of the data/variables used.
  - tidydataset.csv: the final tidy data set, which is the means of all activity per subject for features of interest (mean/std measurements)
